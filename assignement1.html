        <h3>HTML:</h3>
        <p>
            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
             HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS:</h3>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the 
            World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
            This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
             of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS
              in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
              css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
             for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), 
             and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
             content is accessed on a mobile device.

        </p>
        <p>
            Section 3. Operators
            Arithmetic operators – introduce to you the arithmetic operators including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
            Remainder operator – show you how to use the remainder operator (%) to get the remainder left over when one value is divided by another value.
            Assignment operators – guide you on how to use assignment operators (=) to assign a value or an expression to a variable.
            Unary operators – learn how to use unary operators.
            Comparison operators – show you how to use comparison operators to compare two values.

            Logical assignment operators – introduce to you the logical assignment operators, including ||=, &&=, and ??=
            Nullish coalescing operator (??) – accept two values and return the second value if the first one is null or undefined.
            Exponentiation operator – introduce you to the exponentiation operator (**) that calculates a base to the exponent power, which is similar to Math.pow() method.
        </p>
        <p>
